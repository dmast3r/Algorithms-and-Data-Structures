/*
	Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.

1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).

2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)

3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.

See this for more applications.

The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ........

Dynamic Programming solution:-
dp[0] = 1;
dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * dp[i-1-j]), 0 <= j < i

Note - As Catlan Numbers grow very rapidly, many times the problem setter may ask you print the answer modulo 1e9+7, hence modify
this implementation accordingly.
